# PPS_PRACTICALS

here there will be code of all practicals of PPS (Programming for Problem Solving) (3110003) and outputs of code made for GTU

List of Experiments :
1. Write a program to that performs as calculator ( addition, multiplication,
division,subtraction).

2. Write a program to find area of triangle(a=h*b*.5)
    a = area h = height b = base

3. Write a program to calculate simple interest (i = (p*r*n)/100 )
    i = Simple interest
    p = Principal amount
    r = Rate of interest
    n = Number of years

4. Write a C program to interchange two numbers.

   inchesand centimeter

6. Write a program to compute Fahrenheit from centigrade (f=1.8*c +32)

7. Write a C program to find out distance travelled by the equation d = ut + at^2

8. Write a C program to find that the accepted number is Negative, or Positive or Zero.

9. Write a program to read marks of a student from keyboard whether the student is pass
   or fail(using if else)

10. Write a program to read three numbers from keyboard and find out maximum out of
    thesethree. (nested if else)

11. Write a C program to check whether the entered character is capital, small letter,
    digit orany special character.12. Write a program to read marks from keyboard and your program should display
    equivalent grade according to following table(if else ladder)
    Marks Grade
    100 - 80 Distinction
    79 - 60 First Class
    59 - 40 Second Class
    < 40 Fail

13. Write a c program to prepare pay slip using following data.Da = 10% of basic, Hra = 7.50% of
    basic, Ma = 300,
    Pf = 12.50% of basic, Gross = basic + Da + Hra + Ma, Nt = Gross – Pf.
14. Write a C program to read no 1 to 7 and print relatively day Sunday to Saturday.

15. Write a C program to find out the Maximum and Minimum number from given
    10 numbers

20. Write a program to find out sum of first and last digit of a given number.

21. Write a C program to find the sum and average of different numbers which are
acceptedby user as many as user wants

22. Write a program to calculate average and total of 5 students for 3 subjects (use nested for
loops)

23. Read five persons height and weight and count the number of person having
heightgreater than 170 and weight less than 50,
