# PPS_PRACTICALS

here there will be code of all practicals of PPS (Programming for Problem Solving) (3110003) and outputs of code made for GTU


List of Experiments :
1. Write a program to that performs as calculator ( addition, multiplication,
division,subtraction).

2. Write a program to find area of triangle
  
```c
    a = h * b * 0.5
    a = area 
    h = height 
    b = base

```
3. Write a program to calculate simple interest 
   ```c
    i = (p * r * n ) / 100 
    i = Simple interest
    p = Principal amount
    r = Rate of interest
    n = Number of years
   ```

4. Write a C program to interchange two numbers.

5. Write a C program to enter a distance in to 
   kilometer and  convert it in to meter, feet,
   inches and centimeter

```c
   1km = 1000 m 
   1km = 3281 feet
   1km = 39370 inches 
   1km = 100000 cm 
```

6. Write a program to compute Fahrenheit from
   centigrade (f=**1.8*c +32**)           

7. Write a C program to find out distance travelled by the equation d = ut + at^2

8. Write a C program to find that the accepted number is Negative, or Positive or Zero.

9. Write a program to read marks of a student from keyboard whether the student is pass
   or fail(using if else)

10. Write a program to read three numbers from keyboard and find out maximum out of
    thesethree. (nested if else)

11. Write a C program to check whether the entered character is capital, small letter,
    digit orany special character.12. Write a program to read marks from keyboard and your program should display
    equivalent grade according to following table(if else ladder)
    Marks Grade
    100 - 80 Distinction
    79 - 60 First Class
    59 - 40 Second Class
    < 40 Fail

13. Write a c program to prepare pay slip using following data.Da = 10% of basic, Hra = 7.50% of
    basic, Ma = 300,
    Pf = 12.50% of basic, Gross = basic + Da + Hra + Ma, Nt = Gross – Pf.
14. Write a C program to read no 1 to 7 and print relatively day Sunday to Saturday.

15. Write a C program to find out the Maximum and Minimum number from given
    10 numbers

16. Write a C program to input an integer number and check the last digit of number is
evenor odd.

17. Write a C program to find factorial of a given number.

18. Write a program to reverse a number.

19. Write a program to generate first n number of Fibonacci series

20. Write a program to find out sum of first and last digit of a given number.

21. Write a C program to find the sum and average of different numbers which are
acceptedby user as many as user wants

22. Write a program to calculate average and total of 5 students for 3 subjects (use nested for
loops)

23. Read five persons height and weight and count the number of person having
heightgreater than 170 and weight less than 50,

24. Write a program to check whether the given number is prime or not.

25. Write a program to evaluate the series 1^2+2^2+3^2+……+n^2

26. Write a C program to find 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+. ........+1/n.

27. Write a C program to find 1+1/2!+1/3!+1/4!+............+1/n!.

28. Write a program to evaluate the series sum=1-x+x^2/2!-x^3/3!+x^4/4! ...........-x^9/9!
